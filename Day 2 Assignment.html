    <h2>headings are great fun</h2>
    <p>
      This is my first <strong>paragraph</strong> in my new <em>webpage</em>.
      This is going to be great. i am so excited i can hardly contain
      <strong>myself</strong>. Don't you just love paragraphs? I find them very
      useful.

    <h2>web pages are exciting too</h2>
    <p>
      Yes, that is right - web pages can be a lot of fun. Learning how to create
      web pages is easy and <strong>entertaining</strong>. This is my second
      <em>paragraph</em>. I hope you like it.
